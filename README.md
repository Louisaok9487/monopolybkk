Game Name
Bangkok Monopoly

Intro
Welcome to the bustling streets of Bangkok! In this themed digital board game, you'll compete to become a property tycoon. Buy and develop famous locations, from Khao San Road to the Grand Palace, collect rent from your opponents, and strategically manage your empire to bankrupt the competition and claim the city for yourself. ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡­

How to Play
Roll and Move: Start your turn by rolling the dice and moving your token around the board.

Buy and Build: When you land on an unowned property, you have the chance to buy it. Once you own all properties in a color group, you can build houses and hotels on them to charge much higher rent.

Collect Rent: If an opponent lands on a property you own, they must pay you rent.

Chance & Chest: Landing on "Chance" or "Community Chest" spaces will give you a card with a surprise instruction, which could be good or bad.

Win the Game: The objective is to be the last player standing. Bankrupt all of your opponents by making smart investments and driving them out of business to win!
